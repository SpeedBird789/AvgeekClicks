## About this project

In this project, I tried to make a website for a Plane Spotter (learn more about Plane Spotting on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_spotting). Due to time constraint, couldn't add a few more aesthetics which I hope will do once I sit with it again. To summarise:

* You can hire the spotter from the 3 available plans as shown in services with flexible spotting locations. To do so, you have to SignUp/Login first.  
* About section is a short introduction of me; nothing too complicated yet :)
* Banner shows 3 of the many shots that this amazing spotter has to his collection.
* Blogs section displays 3 web-dev related questions and their answers. This however is just for my practice and isn't necessarily related to this project.
* Example works shows some of the latest clicks the spotter has taken from around the globe, acting as a portfolio.

## Some of the tools used in this project are:
1) React Router
2) React Router Hooks
3) Bootstrap, React Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS
4) React Toastify
5) Firebase for authentication and deployment
etc
